        " The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a powerful statistical concept that allows us to make inferences about population parameters based on sample statistics, even when the population distribution is unknown or non-normal. However, for the CLT to hold true, certain assumptions must be met. These assumptions ensure that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",

        " Assumptions for Applying the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
        "1.Independence:\n",

        "The sample size should be sufficiently large. While there is no strict rule for what constitutes a \"sufficiently large\" sample size, a commonly cited guideline is that n ≥ 30 is generally sufficient for the CLT to hold reasonably well.
